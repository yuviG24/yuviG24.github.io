      <p> My name is Yuvi Tarin. I have 2 sibling's, an older sister and a young brother.<br>
        I am 23 years old and I am a mom to a two-year-old daughter. I also have a niece that is one.<br>
        I have lived in Greeley most of my life except for about 5 years I lived in Minnesota.<br> 
        I have lived parts of my life in Mexico as well. I have a lot of family down there.<br>
        My moms side of the family is from texas so we are in fact Dallas Cowboys fans.<br>
        I like going to car meets, playing video games on my PC, and hanging out with my family.
